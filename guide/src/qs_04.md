# Address

Actors communicate exclusively by exchanging messages. Sender actor can
wait for response. Actors can not be referenced directly, only by it is address.
There are two types on addresses, address that references actor that
run in same thread and address that references actor in different thread.
Non thread safe [`Addr<Unsync, A>`](../actix/struct.Addr.html) and thread safe address
[`Addr<Syn, A>`](../actix/struct.Addr.html) respectively. `A` identifies actor and
`Syn` and `Unsync` types of reference. `Syn` is thread save type, `Unsync` is non thread
safe reference.

There are several ways hot to get address of an actor. `Actor` trait provides
two helper methods for starting actor. Both returns address of started actor.

Here is example of `Actor::start()` method usage. In this example `MyActor` actor
is asynchronous and get started in same thread as caller.

```rust
# extern crate actix;
# use actix::prelude::*;
struct MyActor;
impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
}

# fn main() {
# System::new("test");
let addr: Addr<Unsync, _> = MyActor.start();
# }
```

Same example, but returned address is thread safe and can be sent to different thread.

```rust
# extern crate actix;
# use actix::prelude::*;
struct MyActor;
impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
}

# fn main() {
# System::new("test");
let addr: Addr<Syn, _> = MyActor.start();
# }
```

Async actor can get it's address from `Context` object. Context needs to
implement `AsyncContext` trait. `AsyncContext::address()` provides actor address.

```rust
# extern crate actix;
# use actix::prelude::*;
struct MyActor;
impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
    
    fn started(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context<Self>) {
       let addr: Addr<Syn, _> = ctx.address();
    }
}
# fn main() {}
```

## Mailbox

All messages go to actor's mailbox first, then actor's execution context
call specific message handlers. Mailbox in general is bounded. Capacity is
specific to context implementation. For `Context`  type capacity is set to 16 messages
by default and could be increased with 
[*Context::set_mailbox_capacity()*](../actix/struct.Context.html#method.set_mailbox_capacity)
method.

## Message

To be able to handle specific message actor has to provide
[`Handler<M>`](../actix/trait.Handler.html) implementation for this message.
All messages are statically typed. Message could be handled in asynchronous
fashion. Actor can spawn other actors or add futures or
streams to execution context. Actor trait provides several methods that allow
to control actor lifecycle.

To send message to an actor `Addr` object needs to be used. `Addr` provides several
ways to send message.

  * `Addr::do_send(M)` - this method ignores actor's mailbox capacity and puts
  message to a mailbox unconditionally. This method does not return result of
  of message handling and fails silently if actor is gone.
  
  * `Addr::try_send(M)` - this method tries to send message immediately. If
  mailbox is full or mailbox is closed (actor is dead), this method returns
  [`SendError`](../actix/prelude/enum.SendError.html) error.

  * `Addr::send(M)` - This message returns future object that resolves to a result
  of a message handling process. if returned `Future` object get dropped,
  message cancels.

## Recipient

Recipient is specialized version of an address that support only one type message.
It can be used in case when message needs to be send to a different type of actors.
Recipient object can be created from address with `Addr::recipient()` method.

For example recipient can be used for subscription system. In following example
`ProcessSignals` actor send `Singal` message to all subscribers, subscriber can
be any actor that implements `Handler<Signal>` trait.

```rust
# #[macro_use] extern crate actix;
# use actix::prelude::*;
#[derive(Message)]
struct Signal(usize);

/// Subscribe to process signals.
#[derive(Message)]
struct Subscribe(pub Recipient<Syn, Signal>);

/// Actor that provides singals subscriptions
struct ProcessSignals {
    subscribers: Vec<Recipient<Syn, Signal>>,
}

impl Actor for ProcessSignals {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
}

impl ProcessSignals {

    /// Send signal to all subscribers
    fn send_signal(&mut self, sig: usize) {
        for subscr in &self.subscribers {
           subscr.do_send(Signal(sig));
        }
    }
}

/// Subscribe to signals
impl Handler<Subscribe> for ProcessSignals {
    type Result = ();

    fn handle(&mut self, msg: Subscribe, _: &mut Self::Context) {
        self.subscribers.push(msg.0);
    }
}
# fn main() {}
```
